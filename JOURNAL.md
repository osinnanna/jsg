## 10/17/2025 3 PM - (Planning, initial CAD drafts)  

## Overview (9/17/2025 - 10/17/2025)
### Good day reader, welcome to JSG
I first started by planning the whole build. The project takes the clever hexagonal design from the NASA engineers who made the JWST and translates that idea into a functional heliostat array for concentrating solar power. For those who don't know, the system uses an array of mirrors to take the light from the sun and reflect it to a central receiver plate to generate incredible heat. The immediate application is for tasks like cooking or purifying water, but the potential is much broader—imagine channeling that same sunlight through fiber optic wires to light up a room, or creating a high-intensity light source for scientific experiments. 

If you don't get it that's fine as we progress hopefully you come along, if you do though–you may probably ask a question like this:

(PS. It's not AI because of the dashes you can use them using Alt + 0150(en-dashes) and Alt + 0151(em-dashes))

- Why don't you just use square panels instead of hexagons
> In the process of brainstorming (yes AI chatbot brainstorming) I wanted to change it from a hexagon shape to a square shape for these reasons:
	1. It of course has a higher area to reflect sunlight (image of the sun) as against using the hexagon shape.
	2. It is easier to make because it is an easy shape making its implementation simpler.

Although I did end up choosing to remain with hexagons because

1. The wind acting on it would be just a bit less than if it were a square, I can explain this later when actually assembling it.

If you asked a question its fine also if you have some other questions, please feel free to ask. I honestly don't think I've thought of everything.

Enough of the talk now let's just get into the details.

### Details

Above is the proposed working area. It's just a draft area of where I want the finished work to be tested This is the top of the security quarter in my yard. As you can see it has a parapet of about 430mm its pretty spacious about!

This is a draft on the system, that I did yesterday. The only thing that stands now is that the array will be stand alone. And the receiving plate will be stationary and not connected to the array.

## How it will work(concept)
Each panel will be mounted on a device which translates the motion of two different servos (Yaw and Pitch) so each panel can be moved directly. I had some other ideas I will share later but the entry is already long.

Heres some kind of explanation of how each panel is connected and a kind of work flow(for each panel).

### Connection (draft)
Panel #1 <- Mount (Translates Servo movements) <- (Servo A(Yaw) & Servo B(Pitch)) <- Servo driver board <- ESP32(brain or other microcontroller of choice) <- Program

### Workflow (draft)
Program (Move Panel #1 by 2deg(Pitch) and 10deg(Yaw)) -> ESP32 -> Servo driver board -> Servo A and B -> Panel#1 moves 

Thank you for reading, and sorry if it's so long if you have any questions

  

## 10/17/2025 4 PM - Designing PCB and sourcing materials (Hit a crossroads.)  

I wanted to start actually planning out the actual materials I will use, I live in Nigeria so I know that the grants given would translate to a higher price in naira and if I can find local parts that would be great. For the project I wanted a benchmark of about 14 - 18 hexagon panels which would require a maximum of 36 servos since 2 is for one. I first checked online and here is a screen shot of the first option I found 
![motor price.jpg](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MjY0NSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--7b7eb5e3c048f800d1332ae41669eb229252c673/motor%20price.jpg)

10k (approx. $8) for just one is insane considering I had the grand goal of trying to get 36 (360k (approx. $288)). I did end up reaching out to the seller.

After looking more, I found another listing
![motorprice lower.jpg] (/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MjY0NiwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--366f8fb492d29f05a28d77846cec3b4d60418407/motorprice%20lower.jpg)

It dropped to 5,8k (approx. $3.5) which is better than the initial.

I am going to try to look for more, also reaching out to the sellers asking if I can get the 36 in bulk for the price of 3k per unit (approx. $2). 

It is possible to get it for that price here but that will involve actually going there to get it which is not a problem. I'll give an update on the progress of this because it's actually the main part of the project.

> For other people building if you are close to a hardware store, or electronic store which sells these parts it would be better to go there and get them instead of online. This doesn't apply for everyone though.

Since I have the grand plan of using 36 there would need to be 3 individual servo driver boards.
The [PCA9685] (https://learn.adafruit.com/16-channel-pwm-servo-driver/overview) which is the initial choice for this project has a maximum of 16channels which won't contain everything if I go for 18 panels (36 servo motors).

So, I have three choices
1. Reduce the number to just reach the upper limit of the driver boards (resulting in 16 panels -> 32 servos).
> This would be an optimal option still keeping that scale. But there's nothing else it offers. (What if it's not optimal for future expansion (like adding a small cooling fan(s)) or for troubleshooting if a channel ever fails. I do want to see exactly how this project fares. for sterilization, distillation, even teaching purposes. I'll do my best to bring the costs to a minimum, if you have opinions, please express them.

2. Keep on going (Get three servo drivers)
> By doing my best to keep costs down. I can ensure the project works well allowing it to be used beyond this and leaving little room for failure or need to replace parts.

3. Reduce the number of panels
> I'm quite biased to this option. While it is hands down the most viable option, I really didn't take on this project to make a Starlink (just 1 panel) sized heliostat array. It's not only me doing this project by the way I have an elder brother supervising to make sure nothing goes wrong. There is also the option of other classmates coming to help out.

## 10/17/2025 - (Planning, initial CAD drafts)  

## Overview (9/17/2025 - 10/17/2025)
### Good day reader, welcome to JSG
I first started by planning the whole build. The project takes the clever hexagonal design from the NASA engineers who made the JWST and translates that idea into a functional heliostat array for concentrating solar power. For those who don't know, the system uses an array of mirrors to take the light from the sun and reflect it to a central receiver plate to generate incredible heat. The immediate application is for tasks like cooking or purifying water, but the potential is much broader—imagine channeling that same sunlight through fiber optic wires to light up a room, or creating a high-intensity light source for scientific experiments. 

If you don't get it that's fine as we progress hopefully you come along, if you do though–you may probably ask a question like this:

(PS. It's not AI because of the dashes you can use them using Alt + 0150(en-dashes) and Alt + 0151(em-dashes))

- Why don't you just use square panels instead of hexagons
> In the process of brainstorming (yes AI chatbot brainstorming) I wanted to change it from a hexagon shape to a square shape for these reasons:
	1. It of course has a higher area to reflect sunlight (image of the sun) as against using the hexagon shape.
	2. It is easier to make because it is an easy shape making its implementation simpler.

Although I did end up choosing to remain with hexagons because

1. The wind acting on it would be just a bit less than if it were a square, I can explain this later when actually assembling it.

If you asked a question its fine also if you have some other questions, please feel free to ask. I honestly don't think I've thought of everything.

Enough of the talk now let's just get into the details.

### Details

Above is the proposed working area. It's just a draft area of where I want the finished work to be tested This is the top of the security quarter in my yard. As you can see it has a parapet of about 430mm its pretty spacious about!

This is a draft on the system, that I did yesterday. The only thing that stands now is that the array will be stand alone. And the receiving plate will be stationary and not connected to the array.

## How it will work(concept)
Each panel will be mounted on a device which translates the motion of two different servos (Yaw and Pitch) so each panel can be moved directly. I had some other ideas I will share later but the entry is already long.

Heres some kind of explanation of how each panel is connected and a kind of work flow(for each panel).

### Connection (draft)
Panel #1 <- Mount (Translates Servo movements) <- (Servo A(Yaw) & Servo B(Pitch)) <- Servo driver board <- ESP32(brain or other microcontroller of choice) <- Program

### Workflow (draft)
Program (Move Panel #1 by 2deg(Pitch) and 10deg(Yaw)) -> ESP32 -> Servo driver board -> Servo A and B -> Panel#1 moves 

Thank you for reading, and sorry if it's so long if you have any questions
